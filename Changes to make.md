	1. Combat
      	1. Just Scryer & Windstacking to go!
	2. Magma
 
   - Add hyperspeed 2 detection in for special selection.

# Mapping
   - Map Farm
     - Add dropdown for different types of run above X
       - Will allow you to select between run above X void HD ratio, world HD ratio, map level etc

# Challenges
1. ## Trapper/Trappapalooza
   - Have a job related check to see if you aren't fighting and if you have enough trimps to send an army. If they're all working then fire workers to send army?

2. ## Berserk
   - Disable mapping when alive.
   - Farm in lvl6 map for max stacks
   - Farm X amt of maps OR till you have 10x the stats of the improbability

   - Swap to using void HD ratio & void hits survived while inside of VMs for cutoffs?
   - Add a setting to just set a zone where it start buying equip above lvl2 automatically.

# Calc
   - Remove Gamma Burst setting?
     - Currently going to cause some issues in late game scenarios if people don't have it on. 

# Outside of coding
   - Potentially setup a discord server? 
        - Pros would be a commit channel that can allow users to see if they should refresh.


# Feature Requests

   - Heirlooms
     - Also does AT keep heirlooms of heigher quality then selected? I have my quality set to magnificent with any,any,any,any as the modfies I got a popup that an etheral shield dropped but my inventory is empty, does it only keep the exact rarity you select and throw away higher rarity? I really want it to at least keep anything that higher rarity then what I have.

   - C2 Portal
     - Also can you add an option to autoportal if you spend more then x amount of time in a zone, I think that could be usefull for automatically determing when to portal in C2s.

# Bugs

   - Gene Assist
     - Gene Assist has a fun interaction with Void Maps - if you set Gene Assist to keep your breeding timer at 3 seconds, you set HD Farm to farm maps until you can survive one hit in Void Map, and then you jump into Void Gas map, suddenly you can't survive 1 hit anymore because Geneticist were fired to keep up with the breeding timer.
