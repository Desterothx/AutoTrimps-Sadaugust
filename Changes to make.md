# General
   - Finish adjusting tooltip descriptions. Tabs left to do:
	1. Combat
      	1. Just Scryer & Windstacking to go!
	2. Magma
 
   - Add hyperspeed 2 detection in for special selection.

# Mapping
   - Add support for siphonology when at world levels 6-8. 
        - Currently this will try to run maps at levels 3-5 rather than using the minimum map level available of 6.
   - Map Farm
     - Add dropdown for different types of run above X
       - Will allow you to select between run above X void HD ratio, world HD ratio, map level etc

   - Void Maps
     - Add support for farming before void maps. 
		- Add toggle to farm before running voids
    		- Will allow you to input a specific void hits survived / void hd ratio to target

# Challenges
1. ## Trapper/Trappapalooza
   - Have a job related check to see if you aren't fighting and if you have enough trimps to send an army. If they're all working then fire workers to send army?

2. ## Berserk
   - Disable mapping when alive.
   - Farm in lvl6 map for max stacks
   - Farm X amt of maps OR till you have 10x the stats of the improb

3. ## Duel
   - Duel C3 heirloom setting

# Equipment
   - Change AE: Zone to only work if input is above 0.
   - Similar to AE HD Cut-off add hits survived setting that will purchase armour?
     - This would split armour and weapons into two separate settings. At least in u1 anyway, would have to stay the same in u2.
   - Swap to using void HD ratio & void hits survived while inside of VMs for cutoffs?
   - Add a setting to just set a zone where it start buying equip above lvl2 automatically.

# Perky
   - Add target zone input
# Calc
   - Remove Gamma Burst setting?
     - Currently going to cause some issues in late game scenarios if people don't have it on. 

# Outside of coding
   - Potentially setup a discord server? 
        - Pros would be a commit channel that can allow users to see if they should refresh.
