# General
   - Finish adjusting tooltip descriptions. Tabs left to do:
	1. ATGA
	2. Combat
	3. Magma
	4. Nature
   - Convert dropdown settings to functions. 
        - Will allow me to easily show/hide things that change throughout the game. Main things are Prestiges that are shown & heirloom mods.
   - Disable mapSettings & hdStats from being recreated if AT is paused.

# Mapping
   - Add support for siphonology when at world levels 6-8. 
        - Currently this will try to run maps at levels 3-5 rather than using the minimum map level available of 6.

# Challenges
1. ## Trapper/Trappapalooza
   - Have a job related check to see if you aren't fighting and if you have enough trimps to send an army. If they're all working then fire workers to send army?

2. ## Berserk
   - Disable mapping when alive.
   - Farm in lvl6 map for max stacks
   - Farm X amt of maps OR till you have 10x the stats of the improb

3. ## Duel
   - Duel C3 heirloom setting

4. ## Smithless
   - Fix damage target code issues

# Heirlooms
   - Auto Heirlooms
        - Add recycle these mods setting. text input seperated by commas.

# Equipment
   - Change AE: Zone to only work if input is above 0.
   - Change AE: Highest Prestige to a multitoggle. Will add in a disable after running Trimple/Atlantrimp section to it.~~

# Outside of coding
   - Potentially setup a discord server? 
        - Pros would be a commit channel that can allow users to see if they should refresh.
