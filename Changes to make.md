     - Also does AT keep heirlooms of heigher quality then selected? I have my quality set to magnificent with any,any,any,any as the modfies I got a popup that an etheral shield dropped but my inventory is empty, does it only keep the exact rarity you select and throw away higher rarity? I really want it to at least keep anything that higher rarity then what I have.

# Bugs

   - Gene Assist
     - Gene Assist has a fun interaction with Void Maps - if you set Gene Assist to keep your breeding timer at 3 seconds, you set HD Farm to farm maps until you can survive one hit in Void Map, and then you jump into Void Gas map, suddenly you can't survive 1 hit anymore because Geneticist were fired to keep up with the breeding timer.
