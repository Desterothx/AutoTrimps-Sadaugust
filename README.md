# AutoTrimps - SadAugust Fork

## Current Version - Ongoing Development!
- SadAugust Fork. All changes made by SadAugust using Zorn192/GenBTC as base. Currently up-to-date as of 05/2023.

## AT Script Installation

- Browser

Step 1: Install TamperMonkey

https://www.tampermonkey.net/

Step 2: 

Click this link: https://github.com/SadAugust/AutoTrimps/raw/main/AutoTrimps.user.js

If clicking the link does not work, copy the contents of user.js into a new script inside tampermonkey. 

If you are unsure how to do that, copy this:

```
var script = document.createElement('script');
script.id = 'AutoTrimps-SadAugust';
script.src = 'https://SadAugust.github.io/AutoTrimps/AutoTrimps2.js';
script.setAttribute('crossorigin',"anonymous");
document.head.appendChild(script);
```

Press F12 inside the game, this opens the console, and paste the text into it and hit enter, this will load the script. You will have to do this everytime you refresh the game though so I recommend getting tampermonkey to do it for you!

Step 3: 

Configure settings. Will NOT work as intended with default settings. 

- Steam

Step 1: 

Download <a href="https://github.com/SadAugust/AutoTrimps/blob/main/mods.js">mods.js</a> from this directory (right click raw and save link as...), or copy it and make your own mods.js in a text file.

Step 2: 

Navigate to Steam\steamapps\common\Trimps\mods and place mods.js into the folder. If you have other mods installed then just copy the text in AT's mods.js and place it somewhere in the mods.js file.

Step 3: 

Configure your settings. AT will not work properly if they are not configured!
